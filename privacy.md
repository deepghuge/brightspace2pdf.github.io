# Privacy Policy — brightspace2pdf

**Last updated:** 2026-02-21

brightspace2pdf is a Chrome extension that helps instructors and teaching assistants convert Brightspace submission image attachments into a single combined PDF for easier grading.

## Summary (plain English)
- **No uploads:** brightspace2pdf does **not** upload files to any external server.
- **Local processing:** image conversion and PDF generation happen **locally in your browser**.
- **No tracking:** brightspace2pdf does **not** sell data, run ads, or use analytics.

## What the extension accesses
When you open the extension on a supported Brightspace submission page, it may access:

- **Page content on Brightspace** (only what you can already see/access), such as:
  - attachment filenames
  - attachment download links
- **Attachment file content** (images) so it can convert them and build a PDF.

This access is used **only** to perform the extension’s single purpose: generating a combined PDF for the user.

## Data the extension stores
brightspace2pdf may store minimal local state in Chrome storage, such as:
- temporary attachment metadata needed to build the PDF (e.g., filenames, type hints)
- basic UI state (e.g., last scan state)

This data is stored **locally on your device** and is **not transmitted** to any server.

## Data the extension does NOT collect
brightspace2pdf does **not** collect:
- your name, email, address, or any personal profile data
- passwords or authentication credentials
- payment or financial information
- browsing history beyond the current supported Brightspace page
- analytics/telemetry or advertising identifiers

## Third-party sharing
brightspace2pdf does **not** sell, transfer, or share user data with third parties.

## Security
The extension uses your existing Brightspace session in the browser to fetch attachments you already have permission to access. Generated PDFs are saved through your browser’s normal download flow.

## Support emails
If you click “Report a bug” or “Request a feature”, your email client will open a message to the support address. Sending that email is optional and controlled by you.

## Disclaimer
brightspace2pdf is not affiliated with or endorsed by D2L / Brightspace.
