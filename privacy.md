# Privacy Policy — brightspace2pdf / Brightspace PDF Merger (D2L) – HEIC/JPG/PNG to PDF

**Last updated:** 2026-02-27

brightspace2pdf (also listed as **“Brightspace PDF Merger (D2L) – HEIC/JPG/PNG to PDF”**) is a Chrome extension that helps instructors and teaching assistants convert Brightspace (D2L) submission image attachments into a single combined PDF for easier grading.

## Summary
- **No uploads:** brightspace2pdf does **not** upload files to any external server.
- **Local processing:** image conversion and PDF generation happen **locally in your browser**.
- **No tracking:** brightspace2pdf does **not** sell data, run ads, or use analytics/telemetry.

## What the extension accesses
When you use the extension on a Brightspace submission page, it may access:

- **Brightspace page content** needed to locate attachments, such as:
  - attachment filenames
  - attachment download links
  - the attachment order shown on the page
- **Attachment file content (images)** so it can convert them and build a combined PDF.

This access is used **only** to perform the extension’s single purpose: generating a combined PDF for the user.

## Site access and permissions
brightspace2pdf operates on the currently active tab **only when you click the extension**. If prompted, you may choose to allow the extension to run on your Brightspace site (first time per university). This access is used only to read the submission page and download attachments you already have permission to access.

## Data the extension stores
brightspace2pdf may store minimal local state in Chrome storage, such as:
- temporary attachment metadata needed to build the PDF (e.g., filenames, type hints, and attachment URLs)
- minimal workflow state (e.g., job token / current progress)

This data is stored **locally on your device** and is **not transmitted** to any server.

## Data the extension does NOT collect
brightspace2pdf does **not** collect or store:
- your name, email, address, or profile data
- passwords or authentication credentials
- payment or financial information
- analytics/telemetry or advertising identifiers
- browsing history beyond the Brightspace page where you run the extension

## Third-party sharing
brightspace2pdf does **not** sell, transfer, or share user data with third parties.

## Security
The extension uses your existing Brightspace session in the browser to fetch attachments you already have permission to access. Generated PDFs are saved through your browser’s normal download flow.

## Support emails
If you click “Report a bug” or “Request a feature”, your email client may open a message to the support address. Sending that email is optional and fully controlled by you.

## Disclaimer
brightspace2pdf is not affiliated with or endorsed by D2L / Brightspace.
